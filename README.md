# MeScan Python Network IP and MAC Scanner

MeScan scans the local network using ARP requests and identifies active devices by displaying their IP addresses, MAC addresses, and hostnames â€” all in a clean, user-friendly terminal interface.

Unlike many existing network scanners, MeScan prioritizes accuracy, simplicity, and a modern terminal experience. It automatically detects the active interface and subnet, making it ideal for fast local discovery without manual setup.

By default, MeScan:

   Detects your active network interface

   Calculates your subnet range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

   Scans for devices on that range

To scan a custom network range, edit the line that generates ip_range:

ip_range = "192.168.0.0/24"

Or modify the script to accept command-line arguments for more flexibility.
